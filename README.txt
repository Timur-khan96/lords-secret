- You can move camera by moving your mouse to the edges of the game window, zoom with the mouse wheel, and rotate with "Q" and "E" keys. You can speed up time and pause the game by pressing the corresponding buttons in the top-right bar. When switched to the lord, camera is controlled only by mouse motion. 

- You can switch to the plot edit mode by pressing the corresponding button in the middle-bottom bar. Click on the ground (LMB) and move the mouse to start editing, once the rectangle turns green you can click again to establish a new plot. Right mouse button cancels plot creation. You can adjust plot corners by clicking on them and moving them to another position. Once the plot is established you need to click on it to open the plot menu, set plot information, and finish plot creation by pressing accept button in the menu.

- Petitioners arrive at around 8 a.m. Once the first is arrived you can press the bell button in the bottom bar to let them in. Some of them might want to buy a plot, in this case, you need to choose a plot (or make a new one) by clicking on it in the plot edit mode. In the plot info menu, press the accept button to offer the plot to the petitioner. Petitioners leave at dusk, and the number of petitioners that will arrive during the day depend on the village reputation.

- You can switch to your lord by pressing the last button in the middle-bottom. In this mode you can move with WASD buttons, and run while Shift is pressed. While in this mode you can interact with objects and talk with people by pressing left mouse button once the cross in the center of the screen turns green. To switch back to the village mode you can interact with the table in the lord's mansion. If you press right mouse button on a person you will suck their blood to their death, which will draw attention of the people around the lord and restore some of your blood level. Once the blood level (can be found in top-middle bar) drops to zero the lord turns wild and attacks the nearest person or wonders aimlessly in case there is none.

- Village reputation depends on many things, it will go up if you are polite and answer to people's demands, and go down if you are rude and ignorant. By the end of every day it goes up depending on the number of villagers living in your village. However, the reputation will go down if a witness of your crime gets away from your village.
